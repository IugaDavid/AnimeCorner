        <p class="description">The official website for the forthcoming TV anime adaptation of Ken Kawasaki (story) and Yu Furusawa's (arts) golf-themed manga Oi! Tonbo has released a 90-second new trailer. The TV anime is set to premiere in Japan in April 2024.</p>
        <p class="description">The clip introduces the anime's main characters with their voices for the first time, including the protagonist Tonbo Oi played by Rika Hayashi and Iga Igarashi by Hiroki Touchi (Heiter in Frieren: Beyond Journey's End).</p>
        <p class="description">"Tonbo is just a straight kid. All the balls she shots break to the left and right, though! (laugh)." Hayashi said on the website. "The world in Tonbo's eyes is all fresh and full of excitement and thrill. You can't miss the free thinking and many golf scenes. I am very honored to be involved in this very wonderful work. I will do my best to play the role so that everyone who supports Oi! Tonbo will enjoy."</p>

        <div class="posted-by1">by: Timothy Donohoo</div>
        <p class="description">Fans of Berserk can dress like the Black Swordsman himself thanks to a brand-new fashionable collaboration.</p>
        <p class="description">The most striking of these new Berserk items is the black leather jacket. The stylish biker jacket bears the Brand of Sacrifice symbol that's synonymous with protagonist Guts. This makes the Berserk jacket a bit more subtle, but fans will know exactly what the symbols on the clothing mean. However, the item will cost a pretty penny with an asking price of around US$260. The three Berserk-themed watches are based on Griffith, Guts' Berserker Armor and the Skull Night, with Guts' being the most visually imposing.</p>
        <p class="description">Two of these are US$260, although the Guts watch comes at a higher price point of $350. There's also a distressed scarf that evokes Guts' torn cloak, with the metallic pin recreating the Dragonslayer sword and the Berserker armor's design. Sold as a set, these items can be bought for $120. When combined into a single ensemble, Berserk fans who've shelled out the required cash can sport an outfit worthy of the beloved Kentaro Miura series.</p>

As Goku, Vegeta, Whis and Beerus exchange information on the latest events on Earth, with Gohan and Piccolo taking down Cell Max, Goku's awe leads him straight into a Vegeta roast. Goku regrets not knowing that his son was in action due to his duel with Vegeta, prompting the latter to reply, "Heh, heh... indeed. The duel... which... you lost to me." The exchange was notable to fans, with many highlighting Goku's put-out reaction as an example of how Super has truly put the two on an equal footing.</p>

        <div class="posted-by1">by: Chike Nwaenie</div>
        <p class="description">Bleach manga creator Tite Kubo teases further involvement in the Thousand Year Blood War Season 3 to ensure his vision from the manga is fulfilled.</p>
        <p class="description">Bleach manga creator Tite Kubo has teased further personal involvement in the anime's production ahead of Season 3.</p>
        <p class="description">Via Reddit, a Q&A from Kubo's Klub Outside revealed the manga author said he will be more involved in the storyboarding process to ensure his vision is properly translated from manga to anime. A translation taken from X (formerly Twitter) reads, "I'm checking the settings and production of the anime graphics and storyboard for the third cour of the anime. I feel like I'm starting to get more involved/involved in the storyboard details of the episodes. Normally, when a manga is converted into anime format, the image or message of the manga event will vary slightly depending on the audience, so my current work on it is to fill in the discrepancies between the different scenes in detail."</p>
